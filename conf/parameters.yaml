﻿about: >
  This file describes all the numeric parameters for the model. All values
  are assumed to be floats unless otherwise specified, and have the given
  range and precision values.

  Things should be pretty self-explanatory. basic_tabs and advanced_tabs
  contain the parameters for those two pages. measurements controls the
  graphing operations. parameter_help contains help text for each parameter.

  Watch your indentation if you modify this file. Also keep in mind that typos
  make the gods angry.

      webDICE is a simulation tool designed to show how climate change might
      affect people living today and in the future. It is based in the most
      widely used model of the economy and the climate, the DICE model,
      developed by Professor William Nordhaus, of Yale University. webDICE
      allows you to run the DICE model quickly with an easy to use interface.
      You can change the key variables in the model to reflect your views
      about the economy and about climate change and run the model with
      these choices.

      The complete set of DICE variables can be found in the “Advanced”
      version. An abbreviated set of variables is available in the “Basic”
      version.

      The model has been developed by researchers at the University of Chicago
      supported by RDCEP. We are continually working to improve the model and
      the interface. If you have suggestions, contact us at <a
      href="mailto:info-rdcep@ci.uchicago.edu" target="_blank">
      info-rdcep@ci.uchicago.edu</a>.

      To run a simulation click on the “Run Model” button at the bottom of the
      page. The variables are set to the defaults based on our best guess of
      the correct values. You can change the variables to reflect your views
      by moving the sliders. Running a simulation will let you see how the
      outcomes change.

    treaty: >
        The simulated climate treaty approximates an international 
        agreement wherein specific emissions targets are established.  
        These targets represent a fraction of 2005 emissions that would 
        be permitted in and after a given time period.  For example, 
        selecting a value of 25% implies a 75% decrease in emissions from 
        2005 levels.  The user can select a level of emissions reductions 
        for each of three time periods after, 2050, 2100 and 2150.  

        The user can also select the level of participation in the 
        selected treaty.  This parameter will not change the level of 
        emissions relative to 2005 as selected in the climate treaty, 
        but will affect the cost of compliance (as reflected by increased 
        abatement costs).

    temp_co2_doubling: >
        Climate Sensitivity estimates the extent to which the global mean 
        temperature increases when we add greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere.  
        This metric is defined as the temperature increase from doubling the 
        carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere relative to the concentration 
        prior to the industrial revolution.  By adjusting the slider you can 
        discover how different levels of temperature increases affect economic 
        activities and how these economic activities in turn effect climate.

        This metric is defined as the temperature increase from doubling the
        carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere relative to the
        concentration prior to the industrial revolution.  By adjusting the
        slider you can discover how different levels of temperature increases
        affect economic activities and how these economic activities in turn
        effect climate.

    damages_exponent: >
        This model assumes that an increase in global mean temperature will harm
        the economy.  By adjusting this slider, you can not only discover the
        various degrees to which increasing temperature can affect the economy,
        but you can also estimate how these economic damages will in turn affect
        the climate.

    productivity_decline: >
        This metric represents the decline in the rate of growth of productivity
        over time.  This model assumes that the ability to produce goods with a
        given amount of capital and labor increases over time.  However, the rate
        at which growth of production increases is decreasing.  Faster growth
        indicates optimism in the continued ability to produce goods efficiently.
        Slower growth indicates that productivity will decrease over time.

    intensity_decline_rate: >
        Energy intensity is the emissions per unit of economic output.  As energy
        efficiency increases energy intensity decreases; with increased efficiency
        less energy is used to produce output, resulting in fewer emissions.
        Adjust the slider to discover how energy intensity can affect future
        emissions and their economic impacts.

    backstop_ratio: >
        We do not know what the costs of zero-carbon energy will ultimately be.
        The lower the cost of zero-carbon technologies, the cheaper emissions
        reductions will be.  Adjust the slider to reflect your beliefs on how
        low the cost of zero-carbon energy will be and to discover how these
        costs affect climate and the economy.

    abatement_exponent: >
        The cost of reducing emissions will increase as we try to reduce a
        greater percentage of the total. Small reductions, such as through
        efficiency improvements, may be relatively easy while large reductions,
        such as eliminating most uses of fossil fuels, will be expensive. You
        can set how fast the costs of emissions reductions go up as we try to
        eliminate a greater percentage of emissions. The higher the number,
        the faster costs increase.

    backstop_decline: >
        The model assumes that the cost of replacing all fossil fuels with zero-carbon
        energy will cost $1,170 per ton of CO2 today but that these costs will decline
        over time. You can set the speed of this decline anywhere from 0% (these costs
        never go down) to 20% per year, the most optimistic case.

    depreciation: >
        As capital (buildings, machines, factories and similar items) is used, it
        wears out. The model assumes that it wears out at a rate of 10% per year.
        You can choose a value between 8% per year and 20% per year.

    savings: >
        The model assumes that people save 22% of their incomes each year. Savings
        rate do not adjust based on expectations of future events, so that, for
        example, if you set the harms from climate change to be high, people do not
        save more so that they will have a cushion to offset the harms. You can
        adjust the savings rate to be anything from 10% to 25%.

    popasym: >
        The population has been growing but as people get wealthier, the rate of
        growth has slowed down and demographers think that eventually it may stabilize.
        You can choose the level it stabilizes at, the maximum population, to be
        anything from 8 billion people to 12 billion people. The default value is 8.6
        billion people.

    fosslim: >
        Fossil fuel is a non-renewable resource. The total amount of fossil fuel
        available puts a cap on total emissions. Under most scenarios, we do not
        reach this cap by 2200 so the cap has no effect on the output, but if the
        economy grows quickly and energy intensity does not decline very much, we
        may hit the cap. The default value is that there are 6,000 gigatons of carbon
        (Gt C) contained in unrecovered fossil fuels. You can choose a lower value,
        5000 Gt C, based on the assumption that some portion of the reserves will
        not be recoverable, or a higher value, up to 9,000 Gt C, based on the
        assumption that we will continue to discover new sources of fossil fuels.

    elasmu: >
        As they become wealthier, most people value an additional dollar of wealth
        less than when they were poor. A poor person may greatly value an additional
        dollar to pay for necessities, while someone who has these necessities may
        value the additional dollar less. This may not be uniformly true but it is
        thought to be true for most of the population. You can set how fast the value
        of an additional dollar declines from less, by setting the value to 1.0, to
        more, by setting the value to 3.0.

    prstp: >
        The model finds the optimal controls on emissions by finding the controls
        that maximize the welfare of the people alive during the modeled years.
        For this purpose, the model considers people living from now until 600 years
        from now. The pure rate of time preference is a discount rate which allows
        you to account for the fact that some people will be living in the distant
        future. The value of the pure rate of time preference is highly contested and
        many people believe that it is unethical to weight people less because they
        live in the future while others believe that it is appropriate and consistent
        with how people actually make choices. The default value is 1.5% but you can
        set it anywhere from 0% to 10%.
