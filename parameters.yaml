about: >
  This file describes all the numeric parameters for the model. All values
  are assumed to be floats unless otherwise specified, and have the given
  range and precision values.
  
  The order of sections in the interface is the same as the order that they
  are first listed here.

  This is a file that allows the programmer to change what is on the interface of the website
  without having to edit the actual code. It works by having a heirarchy of arrays that
  are passed to index.php. The order is configuration:header:entry:attribute(data about attribute). 
  For example, configuration['parameters'] would contain everything under "parameters:" 
  in the yaml file. parameters is itself an array of entries. Each new entry begins with a " -  "
  Each attribute below the entry (in the form attrbute:data) is stored together with the other
  entry data. This allows you to iterate through each parameter and take its data, such as "min",
  "max", and "default", and generate a range slider in the php code using that data. Attributes such as
  "tab" and "section" define where each entry will go. Tabs and such are autogenerated when index.php runs,
  so it creates what ever tabs the programmer has named in this yaml file.

  This file is set up to make it easy to add new things. Some just need text, like the intital_help below.
  Some need entries, subentries, and data. All you have to do is type in what you need, and it will
  Be findable in index.php under configuration['header'] and any subarrays beneath that. 

  Sorry if that explanation was too convoluted. Basically, all this file does is store data. What happens
  to that data is completely determined by the index.php file.

  Indentation is extremely important in this yaml file. Anything indented by two spaces is assumed
  to be "under" whatever is above it. Not indenting by two spaces makes the yaml reader think it is
  something new.

  webDICE is a simulation tool designed to show how climate change might affect
  people living today and in the future. It is based in the most widely used
  model of the economy and the climate, the DICE model, developed by Professor
  William Nordhaus, of Yale University. webDICE allows you to run the DICE
  model quickly with an easy to use interface. You can change the key variables
  in the model to reflect your views about the economy and about climate change
  and run the model with these choices.

  To run a simulation click on the “Run Model” button at the bottom of the
  page. The variables are set to the defaults based on our best guess of the
  correct values. You can change the variables to reflect your views by moving
  the sliders. Running a simulation will let you see how the outcomes change.
  The most important variables can be found on the “Basic” tab and additional
  variables are on the “Advanced” tab. The “Optimization” tab allows you to
  compute a carbon tax which will reduce emissions so as to balance the costs
  of reducing emissions with the benefits of reducing the harms from climate
  change, all based on the beliefs you have the future and about climate change.

  The model has been developed by researchers at the University of Chicago
  supported by RDCEP. We are continually working to improve the model and the
  interface. If you have suggestions, contact us at
