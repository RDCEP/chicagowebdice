  This file describes all the numeric parameters for the model. All values
  are assumed to be floats unless otherwise specified, and have the given
  range and precision values.
  
  The order of sections in the interface is the same as the order that they
  are first listed here.

  Welcome to WebDICE. This informational help box will describe, in a few
  words, how to use this model and understand its output. It will disappear,
  however, after you create a model run, to avoid cluttering your workspace.
  
  To begin, click "Make New Run" to the left to create a run with default
  parameters.
