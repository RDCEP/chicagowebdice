<h3>Linear carbon model</h3>
<p>Recent studies estimate that peak warming is linearly proportional
  to cumulative carbon emissions <a id="ref8" href="#fn8">[8]</a>. The linear
  carbon model uses this relationship to estimate temperature change as a
  function of cumulative emissions. The model does not include a carbon
  cycle or equations for radiative forcing, and as a result values for
  total carbon in the atmosphere or the upper and lower oceans are not
  computed. The default is set so that temperatures increase when
  cumulative emissions are 1 trillion tons C. This corresponds roughly
  to the default climate sensitivity of 3.2Â°C, which is the default value.
  Because the linear carbon cycle implicitly includes both a carbon cycle
  and radiative forcing, you cannot separately set the climate</p>
