<h3>Linear carbon model</h3>
<p>
    Recent studies estimate that peak warming is linearly proportional to cumulative
    carbon emissions. <a href="#8"><sup>7</sup></a> The linear carbon model uses this relationship to estimate temperature change as a function of cummulative emissions. The model does not include a carbon cycle or equations for radiative forcing, and as a result values for total carbon in the atmosphere or the upper and lower oceans are not computed. The default is set so that temperatures increase when cumulative emissions are 1 trillion tons C. This corresponds roughly to the default climate sensitivity of 3.2 $^{\circ}$, which is the default value.  Because the linear carbon cycle implicitly includes both a carbon cycle and radiative forcing, you cannot separately set the climate
