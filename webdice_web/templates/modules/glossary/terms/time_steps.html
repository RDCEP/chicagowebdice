<h3>Time steps</h3>
<p>The model uses 10 year time steps. It shows output for 20 time steps
  or 200 years, starting in 2005. It runs for runs for 60 periods
  (600 years) in the background so that the end period does not
  influence the calculations of the social cost of carbon or the
  optimal emissions control rate. You can see all 60 periods by
  downloading the CSV file.</p>
