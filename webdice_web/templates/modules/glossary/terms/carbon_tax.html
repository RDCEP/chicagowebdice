<h3>Carbon tax</h3>
<p>A carbon tax is a tax on emissions. Without a tax or some other price on
  emission, people do not consider the full consequences of their actions.
  They can emit CO<sub>2</sub> without considering that this harms others.
  Economists call this a market failure: the price of fossil fuel energy
  does not represent the true price, unlike with most other products in the
  economy. A a result, people use too much fossil fuel energy.</p>
<p>A carbon tax fixes this problem by enforcing people to consider the full
  costs of fossil fuel energy, including the harms that using fuel energy
  will cause due to climate change. A carbon tax is thought by many to be
  the most efficient method of controlling emissions.</p>
<p>There are two ways in the model to impose a carbon tax. The first is
  to choose a carbon tax explicitly through the

  simulated carbon tax option</a>. The second is to choose the optimization
  option. If you choose optimization, the computer calculates an emissions
  path that maximizes the objective function and then determines the
  carbon tax that is necessary to achieve that path.
