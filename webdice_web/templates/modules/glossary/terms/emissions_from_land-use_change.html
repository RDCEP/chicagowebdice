<h3>Emissions from land-use change</h3>
<p>Forests absorb CO<sub>2</sub> as trees and other plants grow. If we cut
  down or burn down forests, we reduce the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that
  they absorb, leaving more CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. We can treat the
  additional CO<sub>2</sub> as the equivalent of emissions. webDICE includes
  these emissions but they contribute only a limited amount overall.
