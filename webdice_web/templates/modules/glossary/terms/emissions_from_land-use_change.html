<h3>Emissions from land-use change</h3>
<p>Forests absorb $CO_{2}$ as trees and other plants grow. If we cut
  down or burn down forests, we reduce the amount of $CO_{2}$ that
  they absorb, leaving more $CO_{2}$ in the atmosphere. We can treat the
  additional $CO_{2}$ as the equivalent of emissions. webDICE includes
  these emissions but they contribute only a limited amount overall.
