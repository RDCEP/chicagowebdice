<h3>Discount rate</h3>
<p>The discount rate is used to determine how much we have to save today
  to produce an amount in the future. For example, if the discount rate
  is 10% and we want to have $110 next year, we need to save $100 today
  because $100 will grow into $110 if invested at 10% for one year. The
  structure of webDICE has an ‘implied’ discount rate: the discount rate
  is not specified explicitly in the model but instead can be computed
  from the growth rate in particular model run, the elasticity of the
  marginal utility of consumption, and the pure rate of time preference.</p>
