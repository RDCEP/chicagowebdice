<h3>webDICE</h3>
<p>
    webDICE is a web-based version of the most widely-used model of the economics of climate change, DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy). webDICE allows users to see the possible effects of climate change using DICE, and also to understand how changes to the model's assumptions change those effects. DICE was developed by Professor William Nordhaus. His book, <em>A Question of Balance</em>, Weighing the Options on Global Warming Policies, is a good place to find more details. Nordhaus's equations, code and additional documentation are available (at <a href="http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/DICE2007.htm">http://nordhaus.econ.yale.edu/DICE2007.htm</a>. Due to computational considerations, we have re-coded the model into a different computer language, python, so that this version may not run identically to the version in <em>A Question of Balance</em> or to other versions found on Professor Nordhaus's website.

    webDICE is based on a model of the global economy in which industrial activity produces emissions, which cause climate change, which in turn harms the economy. The basic model runs under the assumption that there is no policy in place to control emissions. The parameters in the model are based on available data and, where there is no data, a guess. Many these guesses are just that -- guesses -- and you should view the outcome as just one possible scenario. Clicking on the "run model" button shows the results under this scenario. You can change the assumptions to see how these changes affect the economy and people in the future. For example, you can change how fast the price of clean energy goes down (or if it will), how fast the economy will grow, the extent of the harms from climate change, and most of the other assumptions of the model to see what your views on these matters mean for the future.
