<h3>Abatement costs</h3>
<p>Reducing emissions will cost money. These costs are called abatement costs.
  If you run the model under the default, business as usual mode, these are
  zero as emissions are allowed to go uncontrolled. If instead you impose
  a climate policy, either by setting a tax or a treaty or by allowing the
  computer to optimize, these costs will be positive.</p>
<p>The model specifies abatement costs as a fraction of the total output:
  this is the portion of GDP that we spend replacing fossil fuel energy
  with clean energy. The amount is determined by the cost of clean energy
  (called the backstop technology link), the extent of emissions reduction
  (link to emissions control rate) and how many countries or industries
  participate (link to the participation rate). In general, abatement costs
  increase with the extent of the reductions, go down the more countries
  and industries that participate in reductions, and go down as the costs
  of clean energy go down. You cannot change abatement costs directly.
  Instead, you can change each of these three components that make up
  abatement costs.
