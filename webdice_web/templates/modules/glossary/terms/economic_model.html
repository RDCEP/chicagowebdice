<h3>Economic model</h3>
<p>
    webDICE uses an economic model in which labor and capital combine to produce output. The productivity of the economy determines how much output can be produced with a given amount of labor and capital. It is a measure of how skilled our workers are and how good the machines are that they use. The model treats the entire world as a single economic region and therefore does not include differences among countries or trade.

    These three factors - labor, capital, and productivity - change over time in the model to produce a dynamic economy. The population is assumed to grow over time, increasing the supply of labor.(see link) Productivity grows over time but the growth rate slows down (see link). Capital in a given time period is equal to the capital that was available in the last period reduced by wear and tear, plus savings in the last period.(see <a href="capital.html">capital</a>).

<p>
    Economic output is reduced by the harms from climate change (see <a hred="damages_from_climate_change.html">Damages</a>) and by an expenditures spend on reducing emissions (see abatement). What remains can be used by people to consume or to save for the future.
