<h3>Economic model</h3>
<p>webDICE uses an economic model in which labor and capital combine to
  produce output. The productivity of the economy determines how much
  output can be produced with a given amount of labor and capital. It
  is a measure of how skilled our workers are and how good the machines
  are that they use. The model treats the entire world as a single
  economic region and therefore does not include differences among countries
  or trade.</p>
<p>These three factors - labor, capital, and productivity - change
  over time in the model to produce a dynamic economy. The population
  is assumed to grow over time, increasing the supply of

  Productivity grows over time but the <a href="#glossary__productivity">
  growth rate slows down</a>. Capital in a given time period is
  equal to the capital that was available in the last period reduced by
  wear and tear, plus savings in the last period. (see
  <a href="#glossary__capital">capital</a>.)</p>
<p>Economic output is reduced by the harms from climate change
  (see <a href="#glossary__damages">
  Damages</a>) and by an expenditures spend on reducing emissions (see
  <a href="#glossary__abatement">abatement</a>).
  What remains can be used by people to consume or to save for the future.
