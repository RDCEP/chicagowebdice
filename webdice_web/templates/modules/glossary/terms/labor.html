<h3>Labor</h3>
<p>The economy in webDICE uses labor and capital to produce output.
  The labor supply is assumed to grow with the population. webDICE
  starts with the current population (just over 6 billion people) and
  assumes that it will grow to a level that you can set. The default
  level is 8.6 billion. You can adjust this between 8.0 and 12.0
  billion. The following figure illustrates how the growth in population
  changes for various parameter choices:</p>
