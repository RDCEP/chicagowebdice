<h3>Climate Change</h3>
<p>
    The term climate change or global warming refers to the effects of emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases act as a blanket and warm the surface of the earth. As we put more greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, we in effect put on a thicker blanket, warming the planet more. The primary greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide, which we emit when we use of fossil fuels.

    The basic science behind climate change has been understood for more than 100 years. It is the same science that is used to explain why the Moon is cold, the Earth is the right temperature to support life, and Venus is too hot. The Earth's (and the moon's and Venus's) temperature is determined by the relationship between the energy the Earth absorbs from the Sun and the energy it emits back. These two have to be in balance for the temperature to remain stable. Because the Sun is hot, most of its energy is in the form of visible and near-infrared light. The Earth is much cooler, so the energy it emits back into space is has longer wavelengths; it is mostly in the infrared region of the spectrum. Without an atmosphere, the resulting balance of incoming and outgoing energy would mean that the average temperature of the Earth's surface would be about -20 °C (which is -4 °F) -- too cold to support life. The reason the Earth is not actually this cold is that it is blanketed by the atmosphere. The atmosphere is nearly transparent to incoming solar radiation but it absorbs the infrared radiation coming from the Earth. In a sense, it acts like planetary insulation. The effect is to warm the Earth by nearly 35 °C, to an average temperature of around 15 °C.

    The absorption of infrared radiation is due to only minor elements in the atmosphere — the greenhouse gases. The major components of the atmosphere, nitrogen and oxygen, are as transparent to infrared radiation as they are to visible light. The most abundant/significant human-caused greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide. It is only a trace element in the atmosphere, comprising now only about 395 parts per million (ppm), but it has strong effects.

    Carbon dioxide occurs naturally in the atmosphere. Pre-industrial concentrations were about 280 ppm. Over the last century or so, however, humans significantly increased the concentration of carbon dioxide, largely through burning fossil fuels, land use change, and agriculture. When we burn fossil fuels, we inevitably emit the carbon in these fuels in the form of carbon dioxide. Roughly 60 percent of the annual emissions of greenhouse gases on a global basis come from fossil fuels (and 80 percent of U.S. emissions). Land use change alters the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere for many reasons. The most important reason is that trees absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. When we cut down trees, we eliminate this carbon sink. In addition, if we burn the timber or it decomposes naturally, we release the carbon that they stored. A little more than 18 percent of global emissions are from forestry practices. Most of the remainder is from agriculture (13.5 percent globally), which produces emissions from the use of fertilizer and by releasing carbon stored in the soil.

    The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has attempted to summarize the core scientific findings, and they have explanations of the basic ideas as well as detailed discussions of the most recent scientific results. For those who want to understand the core issues, we highly recommend the IPCC's FAQ on climate change, [
