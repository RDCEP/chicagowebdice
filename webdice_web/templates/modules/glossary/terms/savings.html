<h3>Savings</h3>
<p>webDICE assumes that people consume a portion of output and save
  the rest. The default savings rate is 22% of output. Some versions
  of DICE solve for the optimal savings rate. webDICE does not support
  optimization of the savings rate because the optimal savings rate is
  relatively insensitive to assumptions and optimization would
  significantly slow down the model. Instead of optimization, webDICE
  allows users to choose a savings rate between 15% and 25%.</p>
