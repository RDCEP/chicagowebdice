<h3>Optimization mode</h3>
<p>In optimization mode, the computer finds the path of emissions
  reductions that maximizes the objective function. It then translates
  this into a carbon tax that achieves those reductions. The optimal tax
  is determined by the assumptions you choose in the model. It is also
  affected by two parameters that do not otherwise affect model output: the
  <a href="{{ url_for('webdice.glossary_term', term='pure_rate_of_time_preference') }}">
  pure rate of time preference</a> and the
  <a href="{{ url_for('webdice.glossary_term', term='elasticity_of_marginal_utility') }}">
  elasticity of marginal utility of consumption</a>. These parameters
  combine to determine the discount rate used by the optimizer to
  determine how to value future <a href="{{ url_for('webdice.glossary_term', term='consumption_per_capita') }}">
  consumption</a>.</p>

<h4>Installation</h4>
<p>Optimization in webDICE depends on the <a href="http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/">
  IPOPT</a> library which interfaces with our python codebase through the
  <a href="https://github.com/xuy/pyipopt">pyipopt package</a>. IPOPT is
  capable of using several linear solvers â€” webDICE uses the
  <a href="http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/catalogue/ma57.html">MA57 solver from
  HSL</a>. IPOPT also depends on the LAPACK and BLAS libraries. This of
  course means that the user will have to install several libraries in
  order for the optimization to run successfully. General steps for
  installation on a Linux or Macintosh system are as follows (we have
  unfortunately not yet tested these steps in a Windows environment).</p>
<p>If you're able to obtain a license for the HSL libraries, download
  the source code. If you're unable to obtain an academic license for
  the solvers, there is a basic set publicly available that includes the
  MA27 solver, which should work fine. In either case, you'll need to
  accept a license before you can download the code. A basic configure,
  make, make install should suffice to install these libraries.</p>
<p>Download the source code for IPOPT, and uncompress it. Change into the
  ThirdParty/Metis directory, and execute the get.Metis file. This will
  download the source code for Metis, which will be installed during the
  IPOPT installation.
</p>
<p>LAPACK and BLAS libraries are already installed in OS X, in the
  VecLib Framework, so you don't need to install these. On a linux box,
  you should change into the ThirdParty/Lapack and ThirdParty/Blas
  directories, and execute the get.Lapack and get.Blas files. As with
  Metis, source code will be downloaded which will install during the
  installation of IPOPT.</p>
<p>IPOPT installation, like HSL, should be a straight-forward configure,
  make, make install.</p>
<p>An updated pyipopt is not available through pip or easy_install.
  You should download the source code, or clone the repo from footnote [^2],
  move into the directory, and python setup.py install. However, for
  installation to complete successfully, it will likely be necessary to
  modify the setup.py file. Adjust the IPOPT_DIR variable based on the values
  you used in configuring IPOPT (e.g./usr/local). Eg, we pass
  --prefix=/usr/local to our configure scripts, and so leave this as is.
  Depending on the solver you're using and other environmental settings,
  one may need to adjust the extra_link_args, library_dirs, and libraries
  lists. If you have followed the steps above, you should only need to
  comment out 'coinmumps', and uncomment 'coinhsl' in the libraries list.
</p>
<p>It is possible to install and run webDICE without installing any of
  the optimization libraries. Executing an optimized loop is of course not
  possible under such a scenario, and will result in a runtime exception.
  However running other portions of webDICE should succeed without trouble.</p>

<h4>Execution</h4>
<p>Efforts have been made to create an optimization routine that
  balances accuracy with the the swiftness that is required for a
  web-based application. However, calculating an optimized policy
  naturally takes longer than other policy choices. Currently, a user
  can expect this to take between 10 and 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Some features of webDICE increase the solve time of the optimization
  routine. For the time being, the added computation of the BEAM carbon
  model increases the necessary solve time to a point which is infeasible
  for web delivery. As such, optimizing a scenario that includes the
  BEAM model has been disabled.</p>
