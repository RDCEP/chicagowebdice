<h3>Simulated carbon tax</h3>
<p>You have the option of imposing a carbon tax. You can choose the rate
  for three different years: 2050, 2100, and 2150. The model sets the rates
  between those years by interpolating. For example, if you set a rate in
  2050 of $100/ton of CO<sub>2</sub> the model gradually increases the rate
  between now and 2050 to reach that level. If you set the rate in 2100
  to $150 ton/ CO<sub>2</sub> the rate gradually increases from 2050 to 2100.</p>
<p>The tax rate is capped at the level that is needed to eliminate
  fossil fuels. For example, if a tax rate of $200/ton CO<sub>2</sub> would
  be enough to cause a complete switch to wind and solar energy, the
  model assumes that this is the maximum rate, so setting the tax at
  $250 ton CO<sub>2</sub> produces no additional reductions.
