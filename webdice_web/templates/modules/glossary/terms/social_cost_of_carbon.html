<h3>Social cost of carbon</h3>
<p>
    The social cost of carbon (SCC) is a commonly cited metric which estimates the increase in harms from additional emissions. To estimate this, webDICE runs the model once (under your chosen parameters) and then again with one additional ton of $CO_{2}$ and calculates the difference in the two cases. The increase in harms from the additional ton is the social cost of carbon. U.S. government agencies are required to use this metric in cost-benefit evaluation of new programs. Although the commonly used term is social cost of carbon, it is standard to report the value in dollars per ton of carbon dioxide, not carbon.
webDICE follows this practice.

<p>
    webDICE calculates the social cost of carbon for each period by sequentially adding the additional ton in each period. For example, the social cost of carbon in 2055 is the increase in harms one an additional ton of $CO_{2}$ is added in the year 2055.
