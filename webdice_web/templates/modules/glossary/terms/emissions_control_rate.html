<h3>Emissions control rate</h3>
<p>The emissions control rate is the fraction of emissions that are
  reduced or controlled by a climate change policy. For example, if
  a climate change policy limits emissions to 60% of what they
  otherwise would have been, the control rate is 40%. Under the
  business as usual scenario there are no controls on emissions of
  CO<sub>2</sub>, or the emissions control rate is set to zero. If you choose
  to impose a carbon tax or a treaty, or if you allow the computer to
  determine the optimal level of emissions reductions, the emissions
  control rate will be positive as some portion of emissions will
  no longer occur either because of the tax or because it is prohibited
  by the treaty. When the emissions control rate is equal to 1,
  emissions have ceased altogether and there is no further climate

  change. As we reduce emissions more, costs are assumed to go up:
  we choose the lowest cost reductions first and then move to higher
  and higher cost reductions. You can choose the rate at which these
  costs go up by choosing a value for <a href="{{ url_for('webdice.glossary_term', term='abatement') }}">
  abatement costs</a>, with higher values meaning that costs go up
  faster as we reduce more.
