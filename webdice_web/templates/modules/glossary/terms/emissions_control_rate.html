<h3>Emissions control rate</h3>
<p>
    The emissions control rate is the fraction of emissions that are reduced or controlled by a climate change policy. For example, if a climate change policy limits emissions to 60% of what they otherwise would have been, the control rate is 40%. Under the business as usual scenario there are no controls on emissions of $CO_{2}$, o the emissions control rate is set to zero. If you choose to impose a carbon tax or a treaty, or if you allow the computer to determine the optimal level of emissions reductions, the emissions control rate will be positive as some portion of emissions will no longer occur either because of the tax or because it is prohibited by the treaty. When the emissiosn control rate is equal to 1, emissions have ceased altogether and there is no further climate change. As we reduce emissions more, costs are assumed to go up: we choose the lowest cost reductions first and then move to higher and higher cost reductions. You can choose the rate at which these costs go up by choosing a value for abatement costs (link), with higher values meaning that costs go up faster as we reduce more.
