<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>
    The participation fraction is the percentage of global emissions that are subject to the user-selected climate treaty. Setting the parameter less than 1 means that not all countries participate in an emissions control regime or some industries are exempt, or a combination of both. For example, China is about 20% of global emissions. If you set the participation to 0.8, this would produce a result roughly equivalent to excluding China. The result is only rough, however, because the model does not have separate countries or industries.

<p>
    The participation fraction does not affect the emissions control level required by the treaty. Instead, it determines what portion of the world has to meet that level of emissions reduction. As participation goes down, the costs of meeting a target reduction goes up because reductions are concentrated on a smaller part of the economy. The abatement cost parameter (in the technology tab) determines how fast these costs go up.
