<p>The abatement cost, $$\Lambda(t),$$ is the fraction of output spent on
  limiting emissions based on the specifications of a given climate policy.
  There are three components to abatement costs: the emissions control rate,
  $\mu(t)$, the participation fraction, $\varphi(t)$, and the cost of
  replacing all fossil fuels with carbon-free energy (the backstop
  technology), $\theta_{1}(t)$. Abatement costs are the product of these
  three components:</p>
\[
\Lambda(t)=\theta_{1}(t)\varphi(t)^{1-\theta_{2}}\mu(t)^{\theta_{2}}.
