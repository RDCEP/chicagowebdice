<p>If webDICE is run in optimization mode or with an imposed treaty,
  it computes the emissions control rate $\mu$ that gives the appropriate
  level of emissions reductions. To display the carbon tax it uses the
  tax that is implied by the emissions control rate via the equation:
  \[
  \tau(t)=BC(t)\mu(t)^{\theta_{2}-1},
  \]
  where $BC(t)$ cost of the backstop technology.
</p>
<p>If the user sets the carbon tax explicitly, the model finds the
  implied emissions control rate, solving the above equation for $\mu$:
  \[
  \mu(t)=\left(\frac{\tau(t)}{BC(t)}\right)^{1/\left(\theta-1\right)}.
  \]
