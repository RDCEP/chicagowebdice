    Total factor productivity (TFP), $A(t),$ describes how efficiently capital and labor produce output. The initial value, $A(0),$ is set to produce 2005 output given the observed 2005 capital and labor inputs. TPF is assumed to evolve for $t>1,$ given the initial technology level according the equation:
</p>
<p>
    \[
    A(t)=\frac{A(t-1)}{1-A_{g}(t-1)},
    \]
</p>
<p>
    This model assumes that the rate of productivity growth, $A_{g}(t),$  will decrease in the coming decades. The following equation determines the growth rate of TFP:
</p>
<p>
    \[
    A_{g}(t)=A_{g}(0)\times exp(-\Delta_{a}\times(t-1)),
    \]
</p>
<p>
    The default value for $\Delta_{a},$ is ___; users can choose to adjust this parameter between ___ and ____. $\Delta_{a}$ is percentage growth rate of $A_{g}(t)$, the growth rate of TFP. To see this note that
</p>
<p>
    \[
    \frac{d\ln A_{g}(t)}{dt}=\underset{\text{growth rate in \%}}{\underbrace{\frac{A_{g}(t+1)-A_{g}(t)}{A_{g}(t)}}=-}\Delta_{a}
    \]

    If ‘damages to TFP’ is chosen in the damages tab, a portion of damages can be applied to TFP's levels by choosing the ‘damages to productivity growth’ damage function. See ___.
