<p>Total factor productivity (TFP), $A(t)$, describes how efficiently
  capital and labor produce output. The initial value, $A(0)$, is set
  to produce 2005 output given the observed 2005 capital and labor
  inputs. TPF is assumed to evolve for $t>1$, given the initial technology
  level according the equation:
  \[
    A(t)=\frac{A(t-1)}{1-A_{g}(t-1)}.
  \]
  This model assumes that the rate of productivity growth, $A_{g}(t)$,
  will decrease in the coming decades. The following equation determines
  the growth rate of TFP:
  \[
    A_{g}(t)=A_{g}(0)\times exp(-\Delta_{a}\times(t-1)).
  \]
</p>
<p>The default value for $\Delta_{a}$, is ___; users can choose to
  adjust this parameter between ___ and ____. $\Delta_{a}$ is percentage
  growth rate of $A_{g}(t)$, the growth rate of TFP. To see this note that
  \[
    \frac{d\ln A_{g}(t)}{dt}=\underset{\text{growth rate in \%}}{\underbrace{\frac{A_{g}(t+1)-A_{g}(t)}{A_{g}(t)}}=-}\Delta_{a}
  \]
  If ‘damages to TFP’ is chosen in the damages tab, a portion of damages
  can be applied to TFP’s levels by choosing the ‘damages to productivity
  growth’ damage function. See ___.</p>
