<p>Total emissions are the sum of industrial emissions, $E_{Ind}$, and
  emissions from land-use change:
  \[
    E(t)=E_{Ind}(t)+E_{Land}(t)
  \]
  <!-- TODO: link -->
  <a href=#glossary__emissions_land">Emissions from land use are exogenous</a>.
  Economic activity produces emissions. Industrial emissions, $E_{Ind}(t)$,
  in webDICE are equal to the carbon intensity of the economy, $\sigma(t)$
  multiplied by output, and reduced by emissions controls $\mu(t)$.
  \[
    E_{Ind}(t)=\sigma(t)[1-\mu(t)]A(t)K(t)^{\gamma}L(t)^{1-\gamma}.
  \]
</p>
<p>In DICE2010, the carbon intensity of the economy is assumed to
  decline (even without a climate treaty or other policy) due to
  improvements in energy efficiency, according to:
  \[
    \sigma(t)=\sigma(t-1)\times(1-\sigma_{g}(t-1))
  \]
  where,
  \[
    \sigma_{g}(t)=\sigma_{g}(t-1)\times(1-\sigma_{d1}).
  \]
</p>
<p>The initial carbon intensity of the economy, $\sigma(0)$, and the rate
  of decarbonization, $\sigma_{g}(t)$, is assumed to slow down at the
  user-chosen value of $\sigma_{d1}$. The default value of $\sigma_{d1}$
  is 0.003; but users can adjust the value of this rate based on their
  beliefs about the future timing of zero-carbon technologies. Figure 5
  illustrates the evolution of carbon intensity for the choice of
  $\sigma_{d1}$.</p>
