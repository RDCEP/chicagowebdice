<p>The population in period $t$, $L(t)$, evolves according to the weighted
  average formula between the initial population in year 2005, $L(0)$,
  and the asymptotic population in the last year we consider, $L(Tmax)$:
  \[
    L(t)=[L(t-1)\times L(Tmax)]^{0.5}.\text{ }
  \]
</p>
<p>The model sets the initial population in 2005, $L(0)$, to 6.411
  billion and assumes a population adjustment rate of 0.5 per decade.
  The default asymptotic population, $L(Tmax),$, is set to 8.6 billion;
  users can choose to adjust this parameter between 8.0 billion and 12.0
  billion.</p>
