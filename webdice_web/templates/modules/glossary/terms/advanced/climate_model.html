<p>The default climate model in DICE simulates the carbon cycle using
  a linear there-reservoir model where the three reservoirs are the
  deep oceans, the upper ocean and the atmosphere. Each of these reservoirs
  is well-mixed in the short run. A transition matrix governs the transfer
  of carbon among the reservoirs. If $M_{i}(t)$, is he mass of carbon
  (gigatons) in reservoir $i$, then:
  \[
    \left[\begin{array}{c}
    M_{AT}(t)\\
    M_{UP}(t)\\
    M_{LO}(t)
    \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
    \phi_{11} & \phi_{12} & 0\\
    1-\phi_{11} & 1-\phi_{12}-\phi_{32} & \phi_{23}\\
    0 & \phi_{32} & 1-\phi_{23}
    \end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
    M_{AT}(t-1)\\
    M_{UP}(t-1)\\
    M_{L0}(t-1)
    \end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{c}
    E(t-1)\\
    0\\
    0
    \end{array}\right],
    \]
  where the parameters $\phi_{i,j}$ represent the transfer rate from
  reservoir $i$ to reservoir $j$ (per time period), and $E(t)$ is
  emissions at time $t$. The model only includes $CO_{2}$ in its
  emissions factor and atmospheric carbon concentration. Other greenhouse
  gases are assumed to be exogenous and enter the forcing equation
  separately (see below).
