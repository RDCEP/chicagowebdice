<p>The participation fraction, $\varphi(t)\in[0,1]$ is the fraction of
  global emissions that are subject to the user-selected climate treaty.
  If less than all countries participate in an emissions control regime
  or some industries are exempt, $\varphi(t)<1$. This does not affect the
  emissions control level specified by the user, but rather affects the
  cost of reducing emissions to the selected level.</p>
<p>Suppose the emissions control level of the participating countries/sectors
  is called $\mu^{P}(t)$. This can be derived by inflating the global
  emission control rate, $\mu(t)$, by the participation fraction, $\varphi(t)$:
  \[
    \mu^{P}(t)=\frac{\mu(t)}{\varphi(t)},
  \]
  and determining the fraction of output that affected by the emissions
  control regime. If users wish to approach the climate treaty from a
  negotiatorâ€™s perspective they could multiply the emissions control rate
  of the among the participants by the participation fraction to get
  the global control rate set in webDICE.
  \[
    Q^{P}(t)=Q(t)\varphi(t).
  \]
</p>
<p>If $\psi^{P}(t)$ is the aggregate amount spent on abatement by the
  participating countries (which is equal to the total spent on abatement
  by all countries, $\psi(t)$ one can substitute in the above equalities:
  \[
    \psi(t)=\psi^{P}(t)=Q^{P}(t)\cdot\theta_{1}(t)\cdot\mu^{P}(t)^{\theta_{2}}
  \]
  \[
    =[Q(t)\varphi(t)]\theta_{1}(t)[\mu(t)/\varphi(t)]^{\theta_{2}}
  \]
  \[
    =Q(t)\theta_{2}(t)\mu(t)^{\theta_{2}}\varphi(t)^{1-\theta_{2}}
  \]
  where $\varphi(t)^{(1-\theta_{2})}$ represents the increasing marginal
  costs of controlling emissions when participation is less than full
  (which, after adjusting for the sign, is the same marginal costs as
  the emissions control rate). We can think of $\varphi(t)^{1-\theta_{2}}$
  as the participation markup in abatement costs.</p>
<p>Users specify the participation fractions for the years 2050, 2100,
  and 2150. The model interpolates an increasing fraction of participation
  for the years between these periods according to:
  \[
    \varphi(t)=\left\{ \begin{array}{cccc}
    \varphi(2050)+[\varphi(2010)-\varphi(2050)]\times exp(-0.25\cdot t) &  & if & t=2005,...,2045\\
    \varphi(2100)+[\varphi(2050)-\varphi(2100)]\times exp(-0.25\cdot t) &  & if & t=2055,..,2095\\
    \varphi(2150)+[\varphi(2100)-\varphi(2150)]\times exp(-0.25\cdot t) &  & if & t=2105,...
    \end{array}\right.
  \]
</p>
<p>If users choose a participation fraction less than 1, the model still
  forces total emissions to comply with the chosen treaty. This implies
  that the base-line economic and emissions trajectory will not change
  significantly, if it changes at all. By decreasing the participation
  fraction, users are essentially increasing the abatement costs by
  increasing the cost of complying with the user-mandated climate treaty.
  For example, under the default settings, when participation is full,
  $\pi(t)=1$. When only half of global emissions fall under the emissions
  control regime, $\pi(t)=(0.5)^{-1.8}\approx3.5$. This means that
  abatement will be about 3.5 times as costly with only 50% participation.</p>
