    Pre-climate change output $Y(t)$ depends on a (constant-returns-to-scale) Cobb-Douglas production function in technology, capital and labor, denoted by $A(t),K(t)$ and $L(t),$ respectively.
</p>
<p>
    \[
    Y(t)=A(t)K(t)^{\gamma}L(t)^{1-\gamma}
    \]
</p>
<p>
    The capital share, $\gamma$, is set to $30\%$. $A(t)$ and $L(t)$ evolve exogenously. Capital is dtermined within the model based on intitial period capital, an assumed depreciation rate, and an assumed savings rate.
</p>
<p>
    Final usuable output $Q(t),$,  is pre-damages output reduced by the fraction of harms from climate change, $\Omega(t)<1,$ and by resources spent on abatement, $\Lambda(t)<1$.
</p>
<p>
    \[
    Q(t)=\Omega(t)[1-\Lambda(t)]A(t)K(t)^{\gamma}L(t)^{1-\gamma}.
    \]
