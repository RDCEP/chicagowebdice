<p>Pre-climate change output $Y(t)$ depends on a (constant-returns-to-scale)
  Cobb-Douglas production function in technology, capital and labor,
  denoted by $A(t)$, $K(t)$, and $L(t)$ respectively.
  \[
    Y(t)=A(t)K(t)^{\gamma}L(t)^{1-\gamma}
  \]
  The capital share, $\gamma$, is set to 30%. $A(t)$ and $L(t)$ evolve
  exogenously. Capital is determined within the model based on initial
  period capital, an assumed depreciation rate, and an assumed savings rate.</p>
<p>Final usable output $Q(t)$, is pre-damages output reduced by the
  fraction of harms from climate change, $\Omega(t)<1$, and by resources
  spent on abatement, $\Lambda(t)<1$.
  \[
    Q(t)=\Omega(t)[1-\Lambda(t)]A(t)K(t)^{\gamma}L(t)^{1-\gamma}.
  \]
