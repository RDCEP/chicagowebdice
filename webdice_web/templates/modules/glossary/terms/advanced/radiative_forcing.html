<p>Radiative forcing quantifies the change in the earth’s energy balance
  from the addition of greenhouse gasses and other climate forcers to
  the atmosphere. DICE links the amount of carbon dioxide added to the
  atmosphere since 1750 to radiative forcing. Radiative forcing is then
  related to temperature change. This relationship is governed by climate
  sensitivity. This parameter is a way of representing the equilibrium
  temperature from doubling the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>. The default
  setting of the model specifies a 3.2°C rise in temperature for a
  doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. The user can set this between 1°C and 5°C.</p>
<p>The relationship between greenhouse gases and radiative forcing $F(t)$
  is given by
  \[
    F(t)=\eta\frac{\ln\left(M_{AT}(t)\right)-\ln\left(M_{AT}^{1750}\right)}{\ln(2)}+F_{EX}(t)
  \]
  where $F_{EX}(t)$ represents forcing from gases other than CO<sub>2</sub>
  in time period $t$ and $\eta$ represents the increase in forcing from
  the doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. These other forcings are
  estimated in a given period by a linear function of the difference
  between forcings from non-CO<sub>2</sub> today and an estimate of those
  forcings in the year 2100:
  \[
    F_{EX}(t)=F_{EX}(0)+0.1\left(F_{EX}(2100)-F_{EX}(0)\right)\cdot t.
  \]

<p>Radiative forcing leads the warming in the atmosphere, which then
  warms the upper ocean, gradually warming the deep ocean. The model is:
  \begin{align*}
    T(t) & =T(t-1)+\xi_{1}\left[F(t)-\lambda T(t-1)-\xi_{2}\left(T(t-1)-T_{LO}(t-1)\right)\right]\\
    T_{LO}(t) & =T_{LO}(t-1)+\xi_{3}\left(T(t-1)-T_{LO}(t-1)\right)
  \end{align*}
  where the $\xi_{i}$ are the transfer coefficients reflecting the rates
  of flow and thermal capacities of the sinks. In particular,
  $1/\xi_{1}$ is the thermal capacity of the atmosphere and the upper
  oceans, $1/\xi_{3}$ is the transfer rate from the upper ocean to
  the deep ocean, and $\xi_{2}$ is the ratio of the thermal capacity of
  the deep oceans to the transfer rate from the shallow to deep ocean.</p>
<p>The key parameter is $\lambda$, or climate sensitivity, is a way
  of representing the equilibrium temperature from doubling the
  concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>. If we solve the temperature equation
  for a constant temperature (i.e. equilibrium), we get
  $\Delta T/\Delta F=1/\lambda$. If $T_{2xCO_{2}}$ is the equilibrium
  impact of a doubling of CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, we get
  $T_{2xCO_{2}}=\Delta F_{2xCO_{2}}/\lambda$ where
  $\Delta F_{2xCO_{2}}$ is the change in radiative forcing from a
  doubling of CO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, setting $\lambda$ allows us to
  set the climate sensitivity.</p>
