<p>The amount of capital available for use in a given time period,
  $K(t),$  is the sum of depreciated capital from the prior period,
  $(1-\delta_{K})K(t-1),$ and the amount saved, $I(t)$:
  \[
  K(t)=I(t)+(1-\delta_{K})K(t-1),
  \]
</p>
<p>The model sets the default depreciation rate, $\delta_{K},$ to 10%;
  users can choose to adjust this parameter between 8% and 20%.</p>
<p>Total savings, $I(t),$ is a fixed fraction of output, $Q(t),$
  determined by the savings rate, $s$.
  \[
  I(t)=s\times Q(t)
  \]
</p>
<p>Output, $Q(t),$ is split between consumption, $C(t),$ and savings, $I(t).$
  \[
  Q(t)=C(t)+I(t)
  \]
</p>
<p>The model sets the default savings rate, $s,$ to 22% of output. Some
  versions of DICE solve for the optimal savings rate. webDICE does
  not support optimization of the savings rate because Nordhaus reports
  that the optimal savings rate is relatively insensitive to assumptions
  and optimization would slow down the model significantly. Instead of
  optimization, webDICE allows users to choose a savings rate between
  15% and 25%.
