<p>webDICE model estimates the SCC by first determining the consumption
  pathway implied by the user’s choice of parameter values, $C_{b}$.
  Next, it adds a ton of carbon to total emissions in year $t$ and
  recalculates the consumption pathway after that year. $C_{b+1}$.
  webDICE then finds the difference in the two pathways in each year,
  applies the appropriate discount rate, and sums the differences.
  This value is multiplied by $12/44$ to covert from dollars per ton
  of carbon to dollars per ton of carbon dioxide:
  \[
    SCC_{\tau}=\sum_{t=\tau}^{60}\frac{\left(C_{b}-C_{b+1}\right)_{t}}{\left(1+r\right)^{t}}
  \]
</p>
<p>This process is repeated for each of the twenty time periods displayed
  in webDICE (although it calculates the SCC using the differences in
  damages over all $60-\tau$ relevant time steps).</p>
<p>webDICE’s estimates of the SCC will not match those used by the
  federal government for cost-benefit analysis. Although those estimates
  were in done in part using DICE, the government modified DICE to have
  exogenous emissions, GDP and population to enable comparison across
  three distinct models.</p>
