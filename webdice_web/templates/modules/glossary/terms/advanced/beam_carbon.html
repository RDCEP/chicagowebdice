<p>Glotter et al. demonstrate that the default DICE carbon cycle
  representation fails to accurately model oceanic carbon
  uptake <a id="ref2" href="#fn2">[2]</a>. In webDICE, the atmospheric
  temperature anomaly is a function of the concentration of carbon in
  the atmosphere. As was discussed in section 5.1, the atmospheric
  concentration of carbon in each time period in default DICE is
  determined by the concentration from the previous time period augmented
  by emissions and reduced by a constant fraction which is absorbed
  by the ocean. In the default DICE carbon cycle, the atmospheric
  concentration of carbon in each time period is determined by the
  concentration from the prior time period augmented by emissions
  and reduced by a constant fraction which is absorbed by the ocean.
  It is this constant fraction $(1-\phi_{1,1})$, which accounts for
  the unphysical linear absorption of carbon by the oceans in the
  default DICE model.</p>
<p>Actual carbon uptake by the ocean is highly non-linear, characterized
  by a rapid initial uptake period followed by a long-tail equilibrium
  stage. The following graph compares the pathway of carbon mass in the
  atmosphere as prescribed by DICE verses BEAM (the Bolin and Eriksson
  Adjusted Model — based on an established model first published in
  1958) <a id="ref3" href="#fn3">[3]</a> given the same emission trajectory
  (IPCC Scenario A2+) <a id="ref4" href="#fn4">[4]</a>

<h4>Figure 1: Comparison of DICE carbon cycle with BEAM and two other
  physical models</h4>
<p>The BEAM model does a much more complete job than DICE at capturing
  the relevant physics of oceanic carbon uptake. webDICE uses the simplified
  version of BEAM presented in Glotter et al. The authors demonstrate
  that their abbreviated version of the model, which excludes
  temperature-dependent coefficients, offers very similar results to
  the full BEAM model. webDICE utilizes simplified BEAM for ease of
  computation. Glotter et al. construct a similar three reservoir model
  to default DICE,
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\left[\begin{array}{c}
M_{AT}(t)\\
M_{UP}(t)\\
M_{LO}(t)
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
-k_{a} & k_{a}\cdot A\cdot B & 0\\
k_{a} & -(k_{a}\cdot A\cdot B)-k_{d} & \frac{k_{d}}{\delta}\\
0 & k_{d} & -\frac{k_{d}}{\delta}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
M_{AT}\\
M_{UP}\\
M_{LO}
\end{array}\right]+\frac{dE(t)}{dt},
\]
  where $A$ is the ratio of atmospheric carbon to upper oceanic dissolved
  $CO_{2}$ and $B$ represents the partitioning of upper ocean dissolved
  $CO_{2}$ to total inorganic carbon and $\frac{dE(t)}{dt}$ is the emissions
  rate.</p>
<p>BEAM will estimate that carbon stays in the atmosphere longer than
  with the default carbon cycle. As a result, damages from climate change
  will persist for a longer period of time and be higher overall.</p>
<p><b>Additional technical details</b> According to Henry’s Law the
  partial pressure of atmospheric $CO_{2}$ must balance the concentration
  of $CO_{2}$ in the upper ocean: $A=\frac{AM}{OM/(\delta+1)}$, where
  $AM$ is the number of moles in the atmosphere, $OM/(\delta+1)$ is
  the number of moles in the upper ocean, $k_{H}$ represents the
  solubility of $CO_{2}$ in seawater.</p>
<p>$B=1/(1+\frac{k_{1}}{[H^{+}]}+\frac{k_{1}\cdot k_{2}}{[H^{+}]^{2}})$
  where $[H^{+}]$ can be solved for by solving the following:</p>
<p>$\left\{ 1+\frac{k_{1}}{[H^{+}]}+\frac{k_{1}\cdot k_{2}}{[H^{+}]^{2}}\right\} /\left\{ \frac{k_{1}}{[H^{+}]}+\frac{2k_{1}\cdot k_{2}}{[H^{+}\}^{2}}\right\} =\frac{M_{UP}}{Alk}$
  where $Alk=662.7\: Gt\: C$ the alkilinity.</p>
<p>$\frac{dE(t)}{dt}=E(t)/10$ in webDICE to adjust for different timescales.</p>
