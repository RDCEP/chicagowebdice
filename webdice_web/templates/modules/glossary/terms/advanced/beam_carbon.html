<p>Glotter et al. demonstrate that the default DICE carbon cycle representation fails to accurately
model oceanic carbon uptake.2 In webDICE, the atmospheric temperature anomaly is a function of
the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere. As was discussed in section 5.1, the atmospheric
concentration of carbon in each time period in default DICE is determined by the concentration from
the prior time period augmented by emissions and reduced by a constant fraction which is absorbed
by the ocean. It is this constant fraction, ($(1-\phi_{1,1})$) or ($(\phi_{2,1})$) which accounts for the unphysical linear
absorption of carbon by the oceans in the default DICE model.</p>
<p>Actual carbon uptake by the ocean is highly non-linear, characterized by a rapid initial uptake period

in the atmosphere as prescribed by DICE versus BEAM (the Bolin and Eriksson Adjusted Modelâ€”

Scenario A2+).4</p>

<h4>Figure 1: Comparison of DICE carbon cycle with BEAM and two other physical models</h4>
<p>The BEAM model does a much more complete job than DICE at capturing the relevant physics of
oceanic carbon uptake. webDICE uses the simplied version of BEAM presented in Glotter et al.
The authors demonstrate that their abbreviated version of the model, which excludes temperature-
dependent coecients, oers very similar results to the full BEAM model. webDICE utilizes simplied
BEAM for ease of computation. Glotter et al. construct a similar three resevoir model to default DICE,
\[
\frac{d}{dt}\left[\begin{array}{c}
M_{AT}(t)\\
M_{UP}(t)\\
M_{LO}(t)
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
-k_{a} & k_{a}\cdot A\cdot B & 0\\
k_{a} & -(k_{a}\cdot A\cdot B)-k_{d} & \frac{k_{d}}{\delta}\\
0 & k_{d} & -\frac{k_{d}}{\delta}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
M_{AT}\\
M_{UP}\\
M_{LO}
\end{array}\right]+\frac{dE(t)}{dt},
\]
where $A$ is the ratio of atmospheric carbon to upper oceanic dissolved CO2 and $B$ represents the
partitioning of upper ocean dissolved CO2 to total inorganic carbon and $\frac{dE(t)}{dt}$ is the emissions rate.</p>
<p>BEAM will estimate that carbon stays in the atmosphere longer than with the default carbon cycle.
As a result, damages from climate change will persist for a longer period of time and be higher overall.</p>
<p><b>Additional technical details</b> According to Henry's Law the partial pressure of atmospheric CO2
must balance the concentration of CO2 in the upper ocean: $A=\frac{AM}{OM/(\delta+1)}$, where $AM$ is the number
of moles in the atmosphere, $OM/(\delta+1)$ is the number of moles in the upper ocean, $k_{H}$ represents the
solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> in seawater.</p>
<p>$B=1/(1+\frac{k_{1}}{[H^{+}]}+\frac{k_{1}\cdot k_{2}}{[H^{+}]^{2}})$ where $[H^{+}]$ can be solved for by solving the following:</p>
<p>$\left\{ 1+\frac{k_{1}}{[H^{+}]}+\frac{k_{1}\cdot k_{2}}{[H^{+}]^{2}}\right\} /\left\{ \frac{k_{1}}{[H^{+}]}+\frac{2k_{1}\cdot k_{2}}{[H^{+}\}^{2}}\right\} =\frac{M_{UP}}{Alk}$
where $Alk=662.7\: Gt\: C$ the alkilinity.</p>
<p>$\frac{dE(t)}{dt}=E(t)/10$ in webDICE to adjust for dierent timescales.</p>


<p>Reducing emissions will cost money. These costs are called abatement costs.
  If you run the model under the default, business as usual mode, these are
  zero as emissions are allowed to go uncontrolled. If instead you impose
  a climate policy, either by setting a tax or a treaty or by allowing the
  computer to optimize, these costs will be positive.</p>
<p>The model specifies abatement costs as a fraction of the total output:
  this is the portion of GDP that we spend replacing fossil fuel energy
  with clean energy. The amount is determined by the cost of clean energy
  (called the backstop technology link), the extent of emissions reduction
  (link to emisiosn control rate) and how many countries or industries
  participate (link to the partication rate).In general, abatement costs
  increase with the extent of the reductions, go down the more countries
  and industries that participate in reductions, and go down as the costs
  of clean energy go down. You cannot change abatement costs directly.
  Instead, you can change each of these three components that make up
  abatement costs.
