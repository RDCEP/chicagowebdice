<p>In optimization mode, the model finds a vector of emissions control
  rates $\mu(t)$ that maximizes the objective function given the assumptions
  in the model. It then translates these controls into the equivalent carbon
  tax rate, which is:
  \[
    \tau(t)=BC(t)\mu(t)^{\theta_{2}-1}.
  \]

<p>In optimization, participation is complete, because this will always
  reduce costs.</p>
