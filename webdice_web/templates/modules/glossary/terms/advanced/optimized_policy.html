    In optimization mode, the model finds a vector of emissions control rates $\mu(t)$ that maximizes the objective function given the assumptions in the model. It then translates these controls into the equivalent carbon tax rate, which is:

    \[
    \tau(t)=BC(t)\mu(t)^{\theta_{2}-1},
    \]

    In optimziation, participation is complete, because this will always reduce costs.
