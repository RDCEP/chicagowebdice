<h3>Objective function</h3>
<p>The objective function in the model is the discounted sum of utility:</p>
<p>
  \[
  W=\sum_{t=1}^{Tmax}U[c(t),L(t)]R(t),
  \]
</p>
<p>where $U$ is utility, $L(t)$ is the population in period $t$, and $R(t)$
  is the discount factor determined by the pure rate of time preference:</p>
<p>
  \[
  R(t)=\frac{1}{\left(1+\rho\right)^{t}}.
  \]
