<h3>BEAM simplified model</h3>
<p>The default carbon model in webDICE runs quickly and is reasonable accurate over short periods of
  time. Over longer periods, however, it is less accurate. The reason is that as carbon concentrations
  in the ocean go up, its ability to absorb additional carbon goes down. The default model does not
  account for this eect and, therefore, over long periods of time, treats the ocean as absorbing more
  CO2 than it really will. The BEAM model includes a simplied version of ocean chemistry to account
  for this eect and is more accurate over longer time periods. The cost of choosing BEAM is that
  webDICE will run more slowly, particularly in optimization mode, where the model may time out.
