<h3>Warning screen</h3>
<p>Some choices of parameters can produce output that is physically
  impossible. For example, if you choose a damage function that produces
  very large harms, the output of the economy may not be large enough
  to support the population, even at subsistence levels. Because the
  population level in the model is specified externally, the population
  remains high even though they have nothing to eat. Or if you choose
  a climate treaty that demands large reductions in emissions yet
  limits the portion of the world that is subject to the treaty,
  the reductions may be impossible to achieve. For example, if a
  treaty requires a 30% reduction in emissions, and the nations
  subject to the treaty only emit 20% of the total, there is no way
  to achieve the required reductions.</p>
<p>The model flashes a warning label when the output is physically
  impossible. While physically impossible, the results are meaningful
  because they show that under given scenario, something must change.
  For example, if the economy cannot support the population, the
  population has to go down. Seeing the results in these cases,
  therefore, may be helpful in understanding the possible effects
  of climate change. After clicking on the warning label, you can
  see the results from that scenario.</p>
