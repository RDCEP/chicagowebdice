<h3>Radiative forcing</h3>
<p>
    Radiative forcing determines how much the $CO_{2}$ in the atmosphere increases temperatures. It is a measure of the difference between incoming energy from the sun and the energy radiated back out to space from the earth. Any differ results in temperatures increasing. You can choose how much a given amount of $CO_{2}$ in the atmosphere increases temperatures by choosing the value of the climate sensitivity. The default value is 3.2, which means that a doubling of atmospheric $CO_{2}$ produces a $3.2^{\circ}C$ temperature increase.
