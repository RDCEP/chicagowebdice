<h3>Radiative forcing</h3>
<p>Radiative forcing determines how much the CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere
  increases temperatures. It is a measure of the difference between incoming
  energy from the sun and the energy radiated back out to space from the
  earth. Any differ results in temperatures increasing. You can choose
  how much a given amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere increases
  temperatures by choosing the value of the climate sensitivity. The
  default value is 3.2, which means that a doubling of atmospheric
  CO<sub>2</sub> produces a 3.2Â°C temperature increase.
