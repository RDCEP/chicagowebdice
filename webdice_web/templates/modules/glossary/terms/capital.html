<h3>Capital</h3>
<p>
  Capital - machines, land, patents, and so forth - is used to produce economic
  output. The model starts with a specified level of capital based on the current
  economy. This capital depreciates due to wear and tear and obsolescence but in each
  period, the people in the model save a portion of their output, adding to existing
  capital. Therefore, the capital available in a given period is the capital from
  previous time-periods, reduced by depreciation, plus savings.
