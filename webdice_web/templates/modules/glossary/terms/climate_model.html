<h3>Climate model</h3>


<p>
    webDICE includes a model of how emissions of $CO_{2}$ affect temperatures. The model has two components. The first is how carbon moves around the earth, between the oceans and the atmosphere. This component determines long emissions of $CO_{2}$ stay in the atmosphere. The second is how the emissions that stay in the atmosphere increase temperatures. This latter component is called radiative forcing and is discussed there (link).

<p>
    The model of how emission move around the earth assumes that emissions from economic activity are released into the atmosphere. Some of these emissions are absorbed by the upper layers of the ocean and from there into the lower ocean. The rate of absorption into the upper and lower ocean determines how long emissions stay in the atmosphere. There are no parameters choices for the climate model, but in Advanced Move, you can choose the default model, which is used in Nordhau's DICE models, or the “BEAM, simplified” (link) model, which i sa more accurate but slightly slower running model. (Optimization using BEAM may be particularly slow and possibly time out.)
