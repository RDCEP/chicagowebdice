<h3>Climate model</h3>
<p>webDICE includes a model of how emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> affect temperatures.
  The model has two components. The first is how carbon moves around the
  earth, between the oceans and the atmosphere. This component determines
  long emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> stay in the atmosphere. The second is how the
  emissions that stay in the atmosphere increase temperatures. This
  latter component is called <a href="{{ url_for('webdice.glossary_term', term='radiative_forcing') }}">
  radiative forcing</a>.</p>
<p>The model of how emission move around the earth assumes that emissions
  from economic activity are released into the atmosphere. Some of these
  emissions are absorbed by the upper layers of the ocean and from there
  into the lower ocean. The rate of absorption into the upper and lower
  ocean determines how long emissions stay in the atmosphere. There are no
  parameters choices for the climate model, but in Advanced Move, you can
  choose the default model, which is used in Nordhaus’s DICE models, or
  the <a href="{{ url_for('webdice.glossary_term', term='beam_carbon') }}">
  ‘BEAM, simplified‘ model</a>, which is a more accurate but
  slightly slower running model. (Optimization using BEAM may be particularly
  slow and possibly time out.)
