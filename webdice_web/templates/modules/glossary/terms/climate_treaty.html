<h3>Climate Treaty</h3>
<p>You have the option of simulating a climate treaty by setting carbon
  caps in three years, 2050, 2100 and 2150. The caps are a specified
  percentage of emissions in 2005 and apply in each time period until
  the next cap. For example, if the cap for 2050 is 100%, emissions in
  each year between 2050 and 2100 are capped at the 2005 amount.</p>
<p>You can also choose what portion of the world has agreed to the treaty
  by setting the <a href="{{ url_for('webdice.glossary_term', term='participation') }}">
  participation fraction</a>. As participation goes down, the countries
  subject to the treaty have to reduce more aggressively to meet the cap,
  increasing costs.
