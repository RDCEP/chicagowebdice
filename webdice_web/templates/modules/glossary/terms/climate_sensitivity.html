<h3>Climate sensitivity</h3>
<p>Climate sensitivity determines how much temperatures go up for a
  given amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is set based
  on the temperature increase when the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> doubles
  from its pre-industrial level. The default value is 3.2 which means
  that if the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> doubles from its pre-industrial
  level of 280 parts per million (ppm) to 560 ppm, temperature will
  eventually increase by 3.2Â°. The climate sensitivity is highly
  uncertain. You can set it to anywhere from an optimistic value such
  as 1 (the temperatures will not increase very much) to a pessimistic
  value such as 5 (temperatures will increase drastically).</p>
