<h3>Climate sensitivity</h3>
<p>
    Climate sensititivy determines how much temperatures go up for a given amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It is set based on the temperature increase when the concentration of $CO_{2}$ double from their pre-industrial levels. The default value is 3.2 which means that if the concentration of $CO_{2}$ doubles from its pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million (ppm) to 560 ppm,temperature will eventually increase by 3.2ยบ. The climate sensitivity is highly uncertain. You can set it to anywhere from an optimistic value such as 1 (the temperatures will not increase very much) to a pessimistic value such as 5 (temperatures will increase drastically).
