<h3>Clean energy costs</h3>
<p>To reduce emissions, we have to replace fossil fuels with other sources
  of energy that do not produce emissions, such as solar or wind power.
  Replacing fossil fuels with clean energy will cost money, and tis price
  determines how much it will cost to stop climate change. The model
  estimates the cost of replacing a portion (or all_ of the fossil fuel
  system starting with an estimate of the cost of replacing the entire
  fossil fuel system with clean energy. This price is set a relatively high
  level for 2005 of USD1,260/ton C or equivalently, USD344/ton CO<sub>2</sub>.
  The price is assumed to go down over time as our technology improves.</p>
<p>You can choose how fast the price of clean energy goes down. The initial
  rate is 5% per year so that if clean energy costs USD1,000/ton C this year,
  it will cost USD950/ton C next year. If you are optimistic about future
  technology, you can increase the rate at which the price goes down by
  <!-- TODO: Get min and max values -->
  moving the slider to  _ _ _ and if you are pessimistic, you can reduce
  the rate, all the way down to _ _ _.
