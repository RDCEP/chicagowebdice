<h3>Carbon Mass in the Atmosphere</h3>
<p>
    The carbon mass in the atmosphere is the total amount, by mass, of carbon
    in the atmosphere in a given period.
    It includes both naturally occurring carbon and carbon emitted through the use of fossil fuels. Its value is determined by the carbn model (link). Carbon mass in the atmophere can be converted to the parts per million of carbon using the ratio 1 ppm = 2.13 Gt of carbon.
