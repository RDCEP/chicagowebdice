<h3>Pure rate of time preference</h3>
<p>The pure rate of time preference, represented by the Greek letter
  rho, $\rho,$ determines how we count people living at different times
  when estimating the effects of climate change and policies to reduce
  climate change. Suppose that we can spend $1 now to reduce the effects
  of climate change and that doing so produces a $2 benefit in the
  future. To determine whether this expenditure is wise, we have to
  be able to compare the cost of $1 to current people with the $2 benefit
  to future people. The starting point in the model is to calculate
  the change in utility (link) from the losses and gains. If the current
  people are wealthier, for example, they may not gain from an extra
  $2 as much utility as current people would lose by spending $1 to
  reduce emissions. After translating the dollar gains and losses into
  utility, we need to be able to compare the utility of people living
  in different time periods which requires a value for the pure rate
  of time preference.</p>
<p>The model generally adds up the changes in utility to determine the
  overall change in welfare from a chosen policy, but reduces the change
  in utility of people living in the future by a discount factor. The
  discount factor is calculated using the pure rate of time preference
  in the same way we would calculate the present value of money when
  we know the interest rate. If we let the pure rate of time preference
  equal $\rho,$ the utility of people living in time period t is
  $U_{t}/(1+\rho)^{t}.$. The higher the pure rate of time preference,
  the more future changes in utility are discounted.</p>
<p>The use of a positive pure rate of time preference is controversial.
  Some argue that it is unethical to count people living in the future less
  than we count current people. Others argue that a positive pure rate of
  time preference reflects how people actually behave and that a model of
  climate change cannot produce realistic scenarios and policies unless
  they reflect actual behavior. We take no stance on the value for the
  pure rate of time preference. You can choose to set it from anywhere
  between 0 and 10%. The default, which simply reflect the default used
  in the DICE model generally and not necessarily our views, is 1.5%.</p>
