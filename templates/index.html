        <p>The DICE 2007 model, developed by Professor William Nordhaus of Yale
          University, is the most widely used model of the economics of climate
          change.  webDICE is an online simulation of this model which allows users
          to see the effects of climate change on the economy and society.</p>
        <p>The default values in the model only present the user with one set of
          projected potential impacts.  In order to understand the range of
          potential impacts as a result of climate change, the user can adjust
          parameters within the model to reflect differing beliefs about climate,
          the economy and the future. </p>

        <p>This model has been developed by researchers at the University of
          Chicago supported by RDCEP.  We are continually working to improve the
          model and the interface. If you have suggestions, contact us at:</p>

        <h3>Basic Inputs</h3>
        <p>The basic inputs section is designed for students and new users.
          By limiting the set of adjustable variables to those deemed most
          important, users can view the predicted effects of their beliefs about
          the climate, the economy and the future.</p>

        <h3>Advanced Inputs</h3>
        <p>The advanced inputs section is designed for more experienced users.
          The complete set of adjustable variables has been made available,
          allowing the user to assess the effect their beliefs have on the model.</p>
